# 🥐 The Corner Bakery

**The Corner Bakery** is a cozy, story-driven café game where warmth, routine, and gentle conversations shape your days. You run a small neighborhood bakery, serve familiar faces, and listen to their stories — one cup of coffee at a time.

But some places hold more than comfort.

The game slowly builds a deeper narrative beneath its cozy surface, rewarding attentive players who listen closely and reflect on what’s left unsaid.
